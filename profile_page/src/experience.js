                        My role was to create automated tests to validate data accuracy, functionality, and UI behavior.
                        Utilizing Python with Selenium, I created tests to check UI behavior and built
                        an algorithm that reads data from Excel files. Additionally, Python and Pytest created tests that validated desktop
                        application elements with JSON files. Furthermore, using Java with Selenium and MongoDB,
                        we created tests to validate the accuracy of the displayed data on the website with the saved data in MongoDB.
